# BomberVisualNovel
This is a visual novel that I planned to make with my internet friends from the "Bomber" chat using the Naninovel plugin. It was supposed to tell the story of how a newbie comes to the chat, goes through thick and thin and eventually becomes a respected person in the chat. But the screenwriter and artist got lazy, so the project was abandoned ;p
